# React-js

## First Component in Details

To create our first component, we only need two things, an import from react dependency, and a function in our index.js file, and that function is our component, which is a stateless (or Dom for now) functional component that must always return JSX.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";

// stateless functional component
// always return JSX

function Greeting() {
  return <h4>This is Mukhtar and this is my first component</h4>;
}

ReactDom.render(<Greeting />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

- The first letter of the name of a react component function must be capitalized.
- The JavaScript's entry point is the index.js file.
- In the ReactDom.render(<Greeting />, ) the tag must be self closed.
- HTML is referred to as JSX in reactjs, because it has additional functionalities.
- What is under the hood of the component function is

```javascript
const Greeting = () => {
  return React.createElement(element to return='h1', props object={}, children='hello');
}
```
